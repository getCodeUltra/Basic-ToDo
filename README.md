# Basic-ToDo
Very basic, styleless ToDo app written in react.

Adds new items to the list as you press on Add button. Does not add with "enter".
Pressing 'X' three times rapidly while not focused on input deletes the last added item,
Pressing 'A' three times rapidly while not focused on input adds an empty item.
